# KnowledgeDistillation (WIP)
Knowledge Distilation

## Tutorial

1. clone repo and download dataset

```bash
git clone
python3 download_dataset.py
```

2. Train teacher and student model for check baseline

you can see training log [here]() (not yet supported)

Baseline Models

should I have to change model structure for ResNet34 and ResNet101 ? Let me check it first

1. ResNet34 / CIFAR 10, 100
2. ResNet101 / CIFAR 10, 100
3. ResNet34(ImageNet Pre-trained) / CIFAR 10, 100
4. ResNet101(ImageNet Pre-trained) / CIFAR 10, 100
